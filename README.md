# Developer Kickstart: Introduction to Lightning Web Components (LWC)
This project is a foundational pillar of the Developer Kickstart curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. Crafted specifically for budding Salesforce developers, this module introduces the groundbreaking world of Lightning Web Components. LWC opens a new dimension in Salesforce front-end development, emphasizing modern JavaScript techniques, Salesforce data integration, and interactive user interfaces.

## Goals of the Practice
Throughout this project, you'll cultivate a deeper understanding of:

- The pivotal transition from Aura Components to Lightning Web Components, and why LWC is the modern approach to Salesforce UI development.
- Crafting sleek, responsive, and data-driven components using the LWC framework and modern JavaScript standards.
- The significance of component composition, enabling the reuse of smaller components to build larger, more complex user interfaces.

By mastering the basics of Lightning Web Components, you'll lay the foundation for creating intuitive, dynamic, and responsive Salesforce user interfaces. This knowledge solidifies your path in evolving as a full-stack Salesforce developer, ready to craft end-to-end solutions that captivate users and drive business results.

To get started, you'll need a Salesforce Trailhead Playground. If you don't have one, you can create it for free from any Trailhead module.

After you've set up your Trailhead Playground:

1. Install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install Salesforce Extension Pack in Visual Studio Code. This can be done by searching 'Salesforce Extension Pack' in the Extensions view in VS Code and clicking Install.
3. Authorize your Trailhead Playground in Visual Studio Code. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette and type 'SFDX: Authorize an Org', then press Enter. Follow the steps in the browser to log in to your Playground, then return to VS Code.
4. Deploy the Apex Class by right clicking on the `VariablesDatatypesOperators` and  `VariablesDatatypesOperatorsTest` file a using the option SFDX: Deploy Source to Org.

## Running the Test Classes

To run the test classes:

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Type 'SFDX: Invoke Apex Tests...', and press Enter.
3. In the 'Select Test Class' input, select the test class you want to run and press Enter.
4. The test results will appear in the Output panel at the bottom of the screen. You can switch to the 'Test' tab in this panel to see a summary of the test run.
